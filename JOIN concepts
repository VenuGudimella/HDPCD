Notice that above query results in all rows from students(left side table) will NULL values on right table library if match is not found

--select s.*,l.bookname from students s INNER JOIN  library l on s.id = l.id;
Notice that above query results only common rows(intersection basically)

Notice that above query results in all rows from library(right side table) will NULL values on left table students if match is not found

--select s.*,l.bookname from students s FULL OUTER JOIN library l on s.id = l.id;
Notice that the above query results in all rows from both tables

-- select s.*,l.bookname from students s JOIN library l on s.id = l.id;
It resulted in common rows just like INNER JOIN
