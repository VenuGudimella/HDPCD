#INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE ON HIVE
There are limitation for these operations
The table has to be BUCKETED,should be ORC format,certain configurations are to be set
like
hive.txn.manager to Dbtransaction manager
hive.support.concurrency to true

CREATE TABLE transactions(
i int,
j string)
CLUSTERED BY (i) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC
tblproperties ('transactional'='true');

INSERT into TABLE transactions values (1,"hdpcd"),(2,"cloudera");
delete from transactions where i =2;

update transactions set j = "cloudera" where i = 1; /Remember we cannot update bucketed column
INSERT into TABLE transactions values (1,"hdpcd"),(2,"cloudera");
